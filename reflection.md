Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
I wrote a Superhero class to represent a superhero in a video game. The Superhero has an inventory, and a lot of the methods work with the inventory. I also gave my Superhero a health attribute, so some of the methods affect the amount of health the Superhero has. These elements could be used in a game to keep track of what items a character has and how much life they have in the game. I also made an enum for an attribute that the Superhero has: SuperheroWeapon.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
Alongside the methods in the interface, I implemented a default constructor and a full constructor for my class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I felt fairly comfortable with this assignment. I was able to implement most of the methods from Conteact fairly quickly, and I think I added a decent amount of error handling to my methods. Something that I struggled with was being unable to test my methods until I wrote all of them. If I commented out the methods I hadn't implemented yet, I would get an error message telling me that my class needed to implement "Contract." I would advise someone to think ahead about what attributes the class will need in order to carry out the methods in Contract. I kept having to go back and rethink that part of my code.
